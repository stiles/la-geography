# âœ… Custom Domain Successfully Configured!

**Date**: October 26, 2025

## Your New API Endpoint

```
https://api.stilesdata.com/la-geography/lookup
```

## What Was Done

### 1. SSL Certificate
- âœ… Created certificate for `api.stilesdata.com` in ACM (us-east-1)
- âœ… Validated via DNS (CNAME record)
- âœ… Status: ISSUED
- ARN: `arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:399949164916:certificate/bfe4be7c-5101-4b27-b2ea-c130179cba24`

### 2. API Gateway Custom Domain
- âœ… Created custom domain with **EDGE endpoint**
- âœ… CloudFront distribution: `d3bzrf10a71s1b.cloudfront.net`
- âœ… Base path mapping: `/la-geography` â†’ API `v7cwkba61i` (stage: `prod`)

### 3. Route53 DNS
- âœ… Created A record (Alias) pointing to CloudFront
- âœ… DNS propagated and working

### 4. Code Improvements Deployed
- âœ… **Text normalization**: Converts "PACIFIC" â†’ "Pacific", preserves acronyms
- âœ… **Bureau mapping**: Falls back to division-to-bureau mapping when spatial query fails
- âœ… **Contextual nulls**: Shows "N/A (LAFD jurisdiction)" instead of null

### 5. Cleanup
- âœ… Deleted duplicate certificate
- âœ… Updated all documentation with new URL

## Benefits of EDGE Endpoint

- âœ… Uses CloudFront CDN for better global performance
- âœ… Automatic DDoS protection
- âœ… Caching at edge locations worldwide
- âœ… Works with us-east-1 certificate (standard for CloudFront)

## Test Your API

```bash
# Downtown LA
curl "https://api.stilesdata.com/la-geography/lookup?lat=34.0522&lon=-118.2437"

# Del Rey
curl "https://api.stilesdata.com/la-geography/lookup?lat=33.9889445&lon=-118.416534"

# Venice Beach
curl "https://api.stilesdata.com/la-geography/lookup?lat=33.9850&lon=-118.4695"
```

## Example Response

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "query": {
    "lat": 33.9889445,
    "lon": -118.416534
  },
  "results": {
    "neighborhood": "Del Rey",
    "city": "Los Angeles",
    "lapd_division": "Pacific",
    "lapd_bureau": "West Bureau",
    "lafd_station": "Fire Station 62",
    "lacofd_station": "N/A (LAFD jurisdiction)",
    "council_district": "11 - Traci Park",
    "neighborhood_council": "Del Rey NC",
    "school_district": "Los Angeles USD"
  }
}
```

## URLs Still Work

- âœ… **New custom domain**: `https://api.stilesdata.com/la-geography/lookup`
- âœ… **Original URL**: `https://v7cwkba61i.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/lookup` (still works!)

Both URLs point to the same Lambda function, so nothing breaks.

## Cost Impact

**None!** Custom domains and SSL certificates are free:
- ACM certificate: FREE
- Custom domain name: FREE
- CloudFront (EDGE): Included with API Gateway
- Total additional cost: $0.00

## AWS Resources Created

| Resource | Type | Details |
|----------|------|---------|
| Certificate | ACM | api.stilesdata.com (us-east-1) |
| Custom Domain | API Gateway | EDGE endpoint with CloudFront |
| Base Path Mapping | API Gateway | /la-geography â†’ v7cwkba61i:prod |
| DNS Record | Route53 | A record (alias) to CloudFront |

## Troubleshooting Notes

If you ever need to recreate this:

1. Certificate **must** be in `us-east-1` for EDGE endpoints
2. For REGIONAL endpoints, certificate must be in same region as API (us-west-2)
3. CNAME validation record: Don't duplicate the domain name (Route53 adds it automatically)
4. DNS propagation takes 2-5 minutes

## Next Steps / Ideas

### Immediate
- âœ… Custom domain working
- âœ… Code improvements deployed
- âœ… Documentation updated

### Future Enhancements
- Add custom 404/error pages
- Add usage analytics (CloudWatch Insights)
- Add API Gateway usage plans (if you want rate limiting)
- Add more LAPD division mappings if needed
- Create "What is your LA?" web app using this API

## Files Updated

- `docs/API.md` - Updated with custom domain
- `README.md` - Updated with custom domain
- `API_DEPLOYED.md` - Updated with custom domain and EDGE note
- `lambda/lookup/handler.py` - Added text normalization, bureau mapping, contextual nulls

## Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰

You now have a professionally-branded, production-ready API at:

**`https://api.stilesdata.com/la-geography/lookup`**

Perfect for sharing, embedding in web apps, or building your "What is your LA?" tool!
